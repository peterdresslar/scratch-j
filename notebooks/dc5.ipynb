    "1. Hypothesis tests and z-scores\n",
    "00:00 - 00:15\n",
    "Hi, I'm James. Welcome to this course on hypothesis testing in Python. To start, let's look at a real-world example where a hypothesis test was crucial in a decision-making process.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. A/B testing\n",
    "00:15 - 00:51\n",
    "In 2013, Electronic Arts, or EA, launched a video game called SimCity 5. Leading up to its release, they wanted to increase pre-order sales. They used an experimental design technique called A/B testing, which has roots in hypothesis testing, to test different advertising scenarios and see which improved sales the most. Website visitors were split into a control group and a treatment group. Each group saw a different version of the game's pre-order sales page.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Retail webpage A/B test\n",
    "00:51 - 01:18\n",
    "Here's each version of the SimCity 5 pre-order page. The control group saw the version with a banner advertising money off their next purchase with each pre-order. The treatment group saw the version without the banner. EA compared the percentage of checkouts for the two groups to see which performed best. Our naive guess would be that the advertisement increased pre-order sales.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. A/B test results\n",
    "01:18 - 02:06\n",
    "The results of the A/B test were surprising. The treatment page without the advertisement resulted in 43 percent higher sales than the control page with the advert. The experiment proved that our intuition that more discount adverts would result in more sales was false. We might ask ourselves, was the 43 percent difference a meaningful difference between the control and treatment groups, or was it just random chance? To get this answer, we'd need the original dataset from EA, which isn't publicly available. However, the method to answering this question of significance would involve techniques from both the Sampling in Python course and from this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2020\n",
    "02:06 - 02:27\n",
    "Each year, Stack Overflow surveys its users, who are primarily software developers, about themselves, how they use Stack Overflow, their work, and the development tools they use. In this course, we'll look at a subset of the survey responses from users who identified as Data Scientists.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Hypothesizing about the mean\n",
    "02:27 - 03:07\n",
    "Let's hypothesize that the mean annual compensation of the population of data scientists is 110,000 dollars. We can initially examine the mean annual compensation from the sample survey data. Annual compensation, converted to dollars, is stored in the converted_comp column. The sample mean is a type of point estimate, which is another name for a summary statistic. We can calculate it with pandas using the dot-mean method on the converted_comp Series. The result is different from our hypothesis, but is it meaningfully different?\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Generating a bootstrap distribution\n",
    "03:07 - 03:24\n",
    "To answer this, we need to generate a bootstrap distribution of sample means. This is done by resampling the dataset, calculating the sample mean for that resample, then repeating those steps to create a list of sample means.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Visualizing the bootstrap distribution\n",
    "03:24 - 03:38\n",
    "Here's a histogram of the bootstrap distribution. Its bell shape means that it's roughly normally distributed. Notice that 110,000 is on the left of the distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Standard error\n",
    "03:38 - 03:46\n",
    "Recall that the standard deviation of the sample statistics in the bootstrap distribution estimates the standard error of the statistic.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. z-scores\n",
    "03:46 - 04:17\n",
    "Since variables have arbitrary units and ranges, before we test our hypothesis, we need to standardize the values. A common way of standardizing values is to subtract the mean, and divide by the standard deviation. For hypothesis testing, we use a variation where we take the sample statistic, subtract the hypothesized parameter value, and divide by the standard error. The result is called a z-score.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. z-scores\n",
    "04:17 - 04:38\n",
    "Here are the values we calculated earlier. The sample mean annual compensation for data scientists of around 120,000 dollars, minus the hypothesized compensation of 110,000, divided by the standard error gives a z-score of one-point-seven-zero-seven.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. Testing the hypothesis\n",
    "04:38 - 04:45\n",
    "Is that a big or small number? Determining that is the goal of this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "13. Testing the hypothesis\n",
    "04:45 - 04:57\n",
    "In particular, we can now state one of the uses of hypothesis testing: determining whether a sample statistic is close to or far away from an expected value.\n",
    "\n",
    "14. Standard normal (z) distribution\n",
    "04:57 - 05:22\n",
    "One final thing. Here's a plot of the probability density function for the standard normal distribution, which is a normal distribution with mean of zero and standard deviation of one. It's often called the z-distribution, and z-scores are related to this distribution. We'll encounter the z-distribution throughout this course.\n",
